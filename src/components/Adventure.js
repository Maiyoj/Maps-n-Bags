    <p>Hey, I'm Valentine! I'm a 20 something who is passionate about living an adventurous life and helping others to do the same. After working in corporate Human Resources for nearly 2 years, I recently quit my job to travel full time and document my experience along the way. I created this blog to share my travel photos, tips, thoughts, and stories with you!

I traveled out of the country for the first time at 20 years old.  After teaching basic accounting concepts to indigenous(native) communities in Panama through a study abroad program, I fell in love with travel. I loved the exchange of cultures, daring adventures & walking into the unknown. I then went on to spend my 21st birthday in India and my 22nd birthday in South Africa through study abroad programs.

Since graduating college, I continued to make travel a priority - both locally and globally. I found myself extremely unfulfilled and unsatisfied with my professional life. I also wanted to see more of the world and continue having extraordinary experiences. While working, I managed to save as much money as possible for the inevitable. After nearly 2 years, I made the leap and quit my job for full time travel. This was probably the most difficult decision I've ever had to make during my adult life - Do I leave behind what's 'right', 'normal', and 'stable'? Or do something  that I've always dreamed of doing? Fear of the unknown is REAL, yall!

I can now happily say that leaving my job for an extraordinary life was the best decision I've ever made. I am now doing two things I always dreamed of - traveling the world & inspiring others to do the same. So if you're reading this, please know that it means the world to me! I am honored that you've decided to follow along with me on this journey! I hope that I am able to leave you with something that helps you, entertains you, or simply makes you smile. 
KEEP GOING
Make yourself at home and say hi so that i can get to know you as well!</p>
